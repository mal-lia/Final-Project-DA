# Final-Project-DA
This project is part of my Junior Data Analyst program and focuses on analyzing data from internship participants at PT Ousean Digital. The goal is to understand the demographics, preferred departments, and skills of participants, as well as identify patterns to enhance recruitment and promotion strategies for the internship programs.

# 📊 **Final Project: Data Analyst - Internship Participant Analysis at PT Ousean Digital**

## 🔍 **Project Description**  
This project is part of my final assignment as a Junior Data Analyst, focusing on analyzing internship participant data from PT Ousean Digital. The primary objective is to understand the distribution of participants based on demographics, departmental preferences, skills being learned, and to identify interesting patterns that can inform company decisions regarding recruitment and promotion strategies for internship programs.

## 📁 **Dataset**  
The dataset is obtained from the PT Ousean Digital Internship Registration Form, provided in a .csv format. It includes vital information such as:
- Gender
- Province of origin
- University of origin
- Department of interest
- Skills being studied
- Additional personnel-related information

## 📌 **Tools and Libraries**  
This project utilized the following tools and libraries:

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- Matplotlib for visualization

The main approach to this project is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 📈 **Analysis Steps**  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Check for duplicates and missing values  
   - Normalize inconsistent data (e.g., case sensitivity, free text entries)

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Calculate total participants  
   - Assess gender, province, and university distribution  
   - Determine frequency of department selection  
   - Analyze skills being learned by participants  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Pie chart: Gender composition  
   - Bar chart: Distribution of top universities and provinces  
   - Scatter plot: Comparison of male-to-female ratio per department  

4. **Insight & Interpretation**  
   - Analyze gender representation in each department  
   - Examine the concentration of participants by region of origin  
   - Assess the popularity of skills being learned  
   - Draw implications for company promotion and recruitment strategies  

## 📌 **Key Insights**  
- The majority of participants were female (71.9%), with a significant presence in non-technical departments such as HRD, Administration & Finance, and Social Media.
- Most participants hailed from Java, particularly West Java, East Java, and Central Java.
- Public Speaking emerged as the most popular skill, highlighting the participants' emphasis on communication soft skills.
- The WordPress Developer department attracted more male participants, indicating a gender preference in technical fields.
